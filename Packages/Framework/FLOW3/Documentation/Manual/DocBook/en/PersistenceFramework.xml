  <section xml:id="flow3.persistenceframework.introduction">
    <title>Introductory Example</title>

    <para>Let's look at the following example as an introduction to how FLOW3
    handles persistence. We have a domain model of a Blog, consisting of Blog,
    Post, Comment and Tag objects:<figure>
        <title>The objects of the Blog domain model</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata contentdepth="100%"
                       fileref="PersistenceFramework_BlogDomainModel.png"
                       scalefit="1" width="100%"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure></para>

    <para>Connections between those objects are built by simple references in
    PHP, as a look at the <methodname>addPost()</methodname> method of the
    <classname>Blog</classname> class shows:<example>
        <title>The Blog's addPost() method</title>

        <para><programlisting language="php">/**
 * @param \F3\Blog\Domain\Post $post
 * @return void
 */
public function addPost(\F3\Blog\Domain\Post $post) {
    $this-&gt;posts[$post-&gt;getIdentifier()] = $post;
}</programlisting></para>
      </example></para>

    <para>The same principles are applied to the rest of the classes,
    resulting in an object tree of a blog object holding several posts, those
    in turn having references to their associated comments and tags. But now
    we need to make sure the Blog and the data in it are still available the
    next time we need them. In the good old days of programming you might have
    added some ugly database calls all over the system at this point. In the
    currently widespread practice of loving Active Record you'd still add
    save() methods to all or most of your objects. But can it be even
    easier?</para>

    <para>To access an object you need to hold some reference to it. You can
    get that reference by creating an object or by following some reference to
    it from some object you already have. This leaves you at a point where you
    need to find that "first object". This is done by using a Repository. A
    Repository is the librarian of your system, knowing about all the objects
    it manages. In our model the Blog is the entry point to our object tree,
    so we will add a BlogRepository, allowing us to find Blogs by the criteria
    we need.</para>

    <para>Now, before we can find a Blog, we need to create and save one. What
    we do is create the object (using FLOW3's object factory) and add it to
    the BlogRepository. This will automagically persist your Blog and you can
    retrieve it again later. No save() call needed. Oh, and the posts,
    comments and tags in your Blog are persisted as well, of course.</para>

    <para>For all that magic to work as expected, you need to give some hints.
    This doesn't mean you need to write tons of XML, a few annotations in your
    code are enough:<example>
        <title>Persistence-related annotations in the Blog class</title>

        <para><programlisting language="php">/**
 * A Blog object
 *
 * @entity
 */
class Blog {

    /**
     * @var string
     */
    protected $title;

    /**
     * @var \SplObjectStorage
     * @lazy
     */
    protected $posts;

  ...

}</programlisting></para>
      </example>The first annotation to note is the
    <emphasis>@entity</emphasis> annotation, which tells the persistence
    framework it needs to persist Blog instances if they have been added to a
    Repository. In the Blog class we have some member variables, they are
    persisted as well by default. The persistence framework knows their types
    by looking at the <emphasis>@var</emphasis> annotation you use anyway when
    documenting your code (you do document your code, right?). In case of the
    $posts property the persistence framework persists the objects held in
    that SplObjectStorage as independent objects. The
    <emphasis>@lazy</emphasis> annotation is used when reconstituting a Blog
    to avoid loading all the posts immediately. Apart from those annotations
    your domain object's code is completely unaware of the persistence
    infrastructure.</para>

    <para>Let's conclude by taking a look at the BlogRepository code:<example>
        <title>Code of a simple BlogRepository</title>

        <programlisting language="php">/**
 * A BlogRepository
 */
class BlogRepository extends \F3\FLOW3\Persistence\Repository {

    /**
     * Finds Blogs with a matching name.
     *
     * @param string $name
     * @return array
     */
    public function findByName($name) {
        $query = $this-&gt;createQuery();
        return $query-&gt;matching($query-&gt;equals('name', $name))-&gt;execute();
    }
}</programlisting>
      </example>As you can see we get away with very little code by simply
    extending the FLOW3-provided repository class. Nice, eh? If you like to do
    things the hard way you can get away with implementing
    <interfacename>\F3\FLOW3\Persistence\RepositoryInterface</interfacename>
    yourself.</para>

      <title>On the relationship between adding and retrieving</title>

      <para>When you <methodname>add()</methodname> something to a repository
      and do a <methodname>findAll()</methodname> immediately afterwards, you
      might be surprised: the freshly added object will not be found. This is
      not a bug, but a decision we took on purpose. Here is why.</para>

      <para>When you add an object to a repository, it is added to the
      internal identity map and will be persisted later (when
      <methodname>persistAll()</methodname> is called). It is therefore still
      in a transient state - but all query operations go directly to the
      underlying data storage, because we need to check that anyway. So
      instead of trying to query the in-memory objects we decided to ignore
      transient objects for queries<footnote>
          <para>An alternative would have been to do an implicit persist call
          before a query, but that seemed to be confusing.</para>
        </footnote>.</para>

      <para>If you need to query for objects you just created, feel free to
      inject the <classname>PersistenceManager</classname> and use
      <methodname>persistAll()</methodname> in your code.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Lazy Loading</title>

      <para>Lazy Loading is a feature that can be equally helpful and
      dangerous when it comes to optimizing your application. FLOW3 defaults
      to eager loading, i.e. it loads all the data in an object as soon as you
      fetch the object from the persistence layer. That of course can lead to
      massive amounts of objects being reconstituted if you have a large
      object tree. So there might be situations when lazy loading comes in
      handy to defer property thawing in objects until the point when those
      properties are really needed.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Enabling Lazy Loading</title>

        <para>If a class should be able to be lazy loaded, you need to
        annotate it with <code>@lazy</code> in the class level docblock. This
        is done to avoid creating proxy classes for objects that should never
        be lazy loaded anyway. As soon as that annotation is found, AOP is
        used to weave lazy loading support into your code that intercepts all
        method calls and initializes the object before calling the expected
        method. Such a proxy class is a subclass of your class, as such it
        work fine with type hinting and checks and can be used the same way as
        the original class.</para>

        <para>To actually mark a property for lazy loading, you need to add
        the <code>@lazy</code> annotation to the property docblock in your
        code. Then the persistence layer will skip loading the data for that
        object and the object properties will be thawed when the object is
        actually used.</para>

    <title>Inside the Persistence Framework</title>

    <para>To the domain code the persistence handling transparent, aside from
    the need to add a few annotations. The custom repositories are a little
    closer to the inner workings of the framework, but still the inner
    workings are very invisible. This is how it is supposed to be, but a
    little understanding of how persistence works internally can help
    understand problems and develop more efficient client code.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Persisting a Domain Object</title>

      <para>After an object has been added to a repository it will be seen
      when FLOW3 calls <methodname>persistAll()</methodname> at the end of a
      script run. Internally all instances implementing the
      <interfacename>\F3\FLOW3\Persistence\RepositoryInterface</interfacename>
      will be fetched and asked for the objects they hold. Those will then be
      handed to the persistence backend in use and processed by it.</para>

      <para>FLOW3 defines interfaces for persistence backends and queries, the
      details of how objects are persisted and queried are up to the
      persistence backend implementation. Have a look at the documentatoin of
      the respective package for more information. The following diagram shows
      (most of) the way an object takes from creation until it is persisted
      when using the FLOW3 default backend:</para>

      <title>Querying the Storage Backend</title>

      <para>As we saw in the introductory example there is a query mechanism
      available that provides easy fetching of objects through the persistence
      framework. You ask for instances of a specific class that match certain
      filters and get back an array of those reconstituted objects. Here is a
      diagram of the internal process when using the FLOW3 default
      backend:<figure>
