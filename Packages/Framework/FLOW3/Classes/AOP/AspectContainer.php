/**
 * An aspect is represented by class tagged with the "aspect" annotation.

 * classes are wrapped by this Aspect Container.
 *
 * For each advice a pointcut expression (not declaration!) is required to define
 * when an advice should apply. The combination of advice and pointcut
 * expression is called "advisor".
 *
 * A pointcut declaration only contains a pointcut expression and is used to
 * make pointcut expressions reusable and combinable.
 *
 * An introduction declaration contains an interface name and a pointcut expression
 * and is used to introduce a new interface to the target class.
