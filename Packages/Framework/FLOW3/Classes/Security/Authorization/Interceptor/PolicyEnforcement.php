/**
 * This is the main security interceptor, which enforces the current security policy and is usually called by the central security aspect:
 *
 * 1. If authentication has not been performed (flag is set in the security context) the configured authentication manager is called to authenticate its tokens
 * 2. If a AuthenticationRequired exception has been thrown we look for an authentication entry point in the active tokens to redirect to authentication
 * 3. Then the configured AccessDecisionManager is called to authorize the request/action
