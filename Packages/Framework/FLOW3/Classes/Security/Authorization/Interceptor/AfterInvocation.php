/**
 * This is the second main security interceptor, which enforces the current security policy for return values and is usually applied over AOP:
 *
 * 1. We call the AfterInvocationManager with the method's return value as paramter
 * 2. If we had a "run as" support, we would have to reset the security context
 * 3. If a PermissionDeniedException was thrown we look for any an authentication entry point in the active tokens to redirect to authentication
 * 4. Then the value is returned to the caller
